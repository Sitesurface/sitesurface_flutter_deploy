### Requirements

`Dart >=3.0.2` and `Flutter >=1.17.0`

## Getting Started

A command-line tool which simplifies the task of uploading your flutter app to gihub pages. It also fixes some of the common issues faced by developers while deploying to github pages.

## :book: Guide

### 1. Setup the config file

Add your Sitesurface Flutter Deploy configuration to your `pubspec.yaml`. An example is shown below. More complex examples [can be found in the example projects](https://github.com/Sitesurface/sitesurface_flutter_deploy/tree/master/example).

```yaml
dev_dependencies:
  sitesurface_flutter_deploy: "^0.0.2"

sitesurface_flutter_deploy:
  repository: "<url of repository where you want to deploy>"
```

### 2. Run the package

After setting up the configuration, all that is left to do is run the package.

```shell
flutter pub get
dart run sitesurface_flutter_deploy
```

If you name your configuration file something other than `sitesurface_flutter_deploy.yaml` or `pubspec.yaml` you will need to specify
the name of the file when running the package.

```shell
flutter pub get
flutter pub run sitesurface_flutter_deploy --path=path/to/my/file.yaml
```

Note: If you are not using the existing `pubspec.yaml` ensure that your config file is located in the same directory as it.

## :mag: Attributes

Shown below is the full list of attributes which you can specify within your Sitesurface Flutter Deploy configuration.

- `repository`: The url of Github Repository where you want to deploy your site.
- `build`: If you want to override the commands used by package to build the web project then you can pass your commands here
